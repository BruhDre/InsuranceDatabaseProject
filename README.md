# Database System for Insurance Company
## Overview
The following database model in SQL is for an insurance company. Additionally, it provides a Windows Forms application written in C#. The system will let different users log in as a client, agent, or administrator to use the database. Based on their role, they can do a number of operations: manage client data, operations concerning insurance policies, and administrative functions.

## Features

**Agent Operations**: An agent performs activities such as managing insurance policies and claims of clients.

**Administrator Operations**: An administrator can access the database completely and manages all users, policies, agents, and clients.

The system is powered by an SQL database at its backend, which would be formatted to store the key data for clients, policies, agents, and claims.
